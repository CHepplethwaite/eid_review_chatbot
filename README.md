Sure! Here's a clean, professional `README.md` you can use as a starting point for your project. I’ll assume this is an early-stage EID (Early Infant Diagnosis) paper analysis or research assistant project. Let me know if you want it tailored more to Streamlit, LangChain, or another tech.

## ✅ `README.md`

```markdown
# EID Review

A research support tool for reviewing literature on Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) of HIV. This project includes tools for document processing, semantic search, and knowledge extraction from scientific papers in PDF format.

## ⚙️ Features

- Load and process scientific papers related to EID
- Embed and store documents in a vector database
- Perform semantic search and QA over the embedded content
- Built using Python, LangChain, and ChromaDB

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CHepplethwaite/eid_review_chatbot.git
cd eid_review
````

### 2. Set up your environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # or source venv/bin/activate on Linux/macOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

> If using Streamlit or another framework, update this accordingly.

## 📁 Notes

* `.pdf` and `.bin` files are excluded from the repository to reduce bloat and stay within GitHub’s file size limits.
* See `.gitignore` for details on what's excluded.

## 🧠 Future Plans

* Integrate Streamlit web interface
* Use LangChain Retrieval QA
* Support uploading new papers dynamically
* Add evaluation metrics or summary extraction
